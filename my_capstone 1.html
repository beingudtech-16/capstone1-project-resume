        <h2>Summary</h1>
        <p>FRESHER <br/>
            I have an intense interest in technology from my childhood and I am committed to arm myself with the skills. I
            am determined to learn as much as I can and keep up with the latest developments in technology in the years
            to come. I aim to make an impact in this world with my technology skills which I am striving to learn. I wish
            to explore the realm of AI and delve deep into this field. In addition to being a personal goal, my dedication to
            learning in this area is an attempt to make a positive impact on a more equal society where women can flourish
            and realize their full potential in the quickly changing technological landscape</p>
